Individual Reports

Joanne Chia An Weng (joanne0302)
* For the coding portion, Alex and I worked together and built the Domain Page. As well, I helped integrate code into the main code since most people cannot installed meteor on their laptop.
* While working on the project, I learned how to used Meteor and Git commands. 
* I always try to keep up a good communication with the team. Making sure that I’m on track with everyone, as well making sure that everyone knows what I am doing. As well, I was willing to help out others when they are having difficulties with their part.
* I could of improve on my coding skill more. When we were meeting together to work on the project, a lot of time I need to take some time understanding what’s going on first before I can start helping.

Samson Chi-Shing Chung (baganaz)
* Worked on the admin page for the website. Also created most of the user stories.
* This project was my first experience with git, had to learn all the commands and how to work with other users on git. It was also my first experience with web programming, taking this course alongside CSC309, had to learn a lot in order to work on the project.
* My main strength as a team member is that I am very responsive and mostly available to discuss problems about the project
* My main weakness is my lack of experience in web programming. I felt slightly overwhelmed with the multiple technologies as well as programming languages that we needed to use and make the different technologies and languages work together.

Jeremy Johnston (jeremy6543)
* Worked on some of the code for the game, as well as creating the video for the presentation.
* This was my first time working with git and programming on the web so I had a lot to learn in regards to those.  It’s also the first time I’ve done scrum meeting for a project so that was a learning experience in itself.
* My strengths as a team member are being willing to take on any tasks, being reliable to complete tasks, and being able to talk to at any time.
* My main weakness was not having enough experience with coding on the web.  I was able to help out more in the less coding intensive parts but wasn’t that big of help on the main coding parts.

Alex Chang (alexkch)
* My most significant contribution to the project was developing our level design UI, and also making interactive webpages for parts of our website. 
* I learned about the use of git and working with multiple people on a large scale team projects; particularly about the effects of git and how it allows different members of the team to work together with the same code. I also gained valuable experience in web programming, particularly in the use of Javascript and styling with css.
* My main strength as a team member was that I was willing to cooperate with my team members, such as being able to take suggestions from team members and incorporating it into my work, as well as giving constructive criticism and opinions on certain tasks.
* My main weakness was that I was not very experience in web design, and often had to look up and learn much of coding online.

Joseph Lee (josephlee427)
* The significant contributions include the game mechanics -- by prodding around and trying to learn a way to have the block of codes being stacked up, as well as coming up with some problems for the game.
* This was the first time I used git, and although it is a bit similar to subversion, it still took some time to get used to the git commands. In addition, it was my first big group assignment, and first time working with Meteor/HTML/PHP/ any web development. I also learned that Windows has a lot of problems with programs that help with development.
* My strength is that I am always willing to learn, therefore always am willing to take on any task as I feel that it would be beneficial in the future. I am also open-minded and would always welcome suggestions and feedback if anyone had anything to say.
* As a team member, my weakness would include my lack of knowledge in some of the languages. I also feel like I could have been more attentive in the meetings and put more input, but I was a little bit lost as I did not have that much experience in these kinds of environments.
