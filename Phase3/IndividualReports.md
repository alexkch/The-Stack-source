Individual Reports

Joanne Chia An Weng (joanne0302)
* For the coding portion, Alex and I worked together and built the Domain Page. As well, I helped integrate code into the main code since most people cannot installed meteor on their laptop.
* While working on the project, I learned how to used Meteor and Git commands. 
* I always try to keep up a good communication with the team. Making sure that I’m on track with everyone, as well making sure that everyone knows what I am doing.
* I could of improve on my coding skill more. When we were meeting together to work on the project, a lot of time I need to take some time understanding what’s going on first before I can start helping.

Samson Chi-Shing Chung (baganaz)
Worked on the admin page for the website. Also created most of the user stories.
This project was my first experience with git, had to learn all the commands and how to work with other users on git. It was also my first experience with web programming, taking this course alongside CSC309, had to learn a lot in order to work on the project.
My main strength as a team member is that I am very responsive and mostly available to discuss problems about the project
My main weakness is my lack of experience in web programming. I felt slightly overwhelmed with the multiple technologies as well as programming languages that we needed to use and make the different technologies and languages work together.

Jeremy Johnston (jeremy6543)
Worked on some of the code for the game, as well as creating the video for the presentation.
This was my first time working with git and programming on the web so I had a lot to learn in regards to those.  It’s also the first time I’ve done scrum meeting for a project so that was a learning experience in itself.
My strengths as a team member are being willing to take on any tasks, being reliable to complete tasks, and being able to talk to at any time.
My main weakness was not having enough experience with coding on the web.  I was able to help out more in the less coding intensive parts but wasn’t that big of help on the main coding parts.
