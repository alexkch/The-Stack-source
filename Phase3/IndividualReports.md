Individual Reports

Joanne Chia An Weng (joanne0302)
For the coding portion, Alex and I worked together and built the Domain Page. As well, I helped integrate code into the main code since most people cannot installed meteor on their laptop.
While working on the project, I learned how to used Meteor and Git commands. 
I always try to keep up a good communication with the team. Making sure that I’m on track with everyone, as well making sure that everyone knows what I am doing.
I could of improve on my coding skill more. When we were meeting together to work on the project, a lot of time I need to take some time understanding what’s going on first before I can start helping.
