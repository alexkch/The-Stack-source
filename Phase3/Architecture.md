	In our project, our architectural design was based off of the open source program Meteor. Meteor allowed our project to incorporate idea such as a login page, a template for our website, and include several built-in packages such as noSQL and node.js. noSQL was important in the sense that we needed to have a database of all of the questions, keeping track of the progress, and keeping track of the leadership boards. Meteor itself was a program that tied all of the packages together to make the web application. 
	
	In addition to Meteor, we also used HTML canvas to make a box on our page, which includes a grid that would allow the blocks of code to snap onto it and allow us to make them stack and make the code.

	Part of the back-end development also included PHP which we used to create dynamic content and store cookies so we can keep track of the users progression in the game.
